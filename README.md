# COVID19
My work on Covid19 Datasets using Python.
The Covid-19 datasets have been sourced from the John Hopkins institute. These visualisations are written in Python and various libraries like Pandas and folium.
The Folium graph is an interactive time-stamped visualisation. The visualisation is generated and saved based on run date. A sample html output is attached is attached.

The folium map is interactive and comes with a Date slider at the bottom similar to this figure:
