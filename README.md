# COVID19
My work on Covid19 Datasets using Python.
The Covid-19 datasets have been sourced from the John Hopkins institute. These visualisations are written in Python and various libraries like Pandas and folium.
The Folium graph is an interactive time-stamped visualisation. The visualisation is generated and saved as an html file. This is also shown on your browser in a new window. Note that each time you run the Python program it would read the latest avaiable data published by John Hopkins and create a new visualisation.

The folium map is interactive and comes with a Date slider at the bottom similar to this figure:
